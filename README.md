# Online Book Review Application

Welcome to the Online Book Review Application! This project is part of the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate program, designed to help you gain hands-on experience in developing server-side applications using Node.js and Express.js.

## About Me

I am currently enrolled in the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate program and actively working on this project as part of my coursework. This repository contains my implementation of the Online Book Review Application.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will develop a RESTful web service that enables users to explore, review, and manage book ratings and reviews. As a back-end developer, your role is to implement the server-side application using Node.js and Express.js.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork the [expressBookReviews](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/expressBookReviews) repository from the IBM Developer Skills Network organization into your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local development environment using Git.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/expressBookReviews.git
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies using npm.
   ```
   cd expressBookReviews
   npm install
   ```
4. **Explore the Skeleton Code**: Review the existing code provided in the repository, including the skeleton code for the server-side application written in Node.js and Express.js.
5. **Implement Required Features**: Implement the CRUD capabilities as HTTP methods in your Express server to meet the project requirements.
6. **Test Using Postman**: Use Postman to test the implemented features by sending HTTP requests to the server and verifying the responses.
7. **Implement Authentication**: Implement session and JWT authentication to restrict certain operations to logged-in users only.
8. **Enhance with Promises/Callbacks/Async Await**: Enhance your code using Promises, Callbacks, or Async/Await functions to support concurrent user interactions without blocking operations.

## Project Structure

The project repository includes the following files and directories:

- **server.js**: Main entry point for the Express server.
- **routes/**: Directory containing route handlers for different endpoints.
- **controllers/**: Directory containing controller functions to handle request processing.
- **models/**: Directory containing data models and schema definitions.
- **middlewares/**: Directory containing custom middleware functions for authentication and request processing.
- **config/**: Directory containing configuration files for session and JWT authentication.
- **data/books.js**: File containing preloaded book information.
- **public/**: Directory containing static assets (if any).
- **test/**: Directory containing test scripts (optional).

## Dependencies

- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the server (optional for testing).
- **jsonwebtoken**: Library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
- **express-session**: Middleware for managing session data in Express applications.

## Usage

Once you have implemented and tested the required features, you can deploy the server-side application to a hosting platform or run it locally for development and testing purposes.
